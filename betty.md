Chez Betty
==========

Chez Betty is a co-op run by the graduate students in the CS department. It's located in the graduate student lounge and has snacks, drinks, and even near-meals in a pinch. Betty's built on the honor system, let us know what food you take and how much money you put in the box, and it'll automatically keep track of your account balance for you. Betty's always looking for volunteers, to get involved, shoot an email to chez-betty@umich.edu or check out `#chezbetty` on the [cseg slack](https://csegumich.slack.com).

Other cool features of the lounge are a wall of whiteboard, great for groups, TV for relaxing, or a Bluetooth sound bar for while you're chillin.

To learn more about about Betty, go visit the grad lounge -- located on the second floor just off the landing from the straight stairs -- or take a digital tour at [chezbetty.eecs.umich.edu](https://chezbetty.eecs.umich.edu).
