Chez Betty
==========

*Update 2019:* Chez Betty is back!!!

Chez Betty is a food co-op run by graduate students in the CSE department. It's located in the graduate student lounge and has snacks, drinks, and easy-to-make meals. Betty's built on the honor system, so you pick what food you want, login on the terminal, and enter your purchase. You can also keep money in your account so you don't have to worry about making change.

Betty's always looking for volunteers. To get involved, shoot an email to [chez-betty@umich.edu](mailto:chez-betty@umich.edu).

Betty tries to keep its food as inexpensive as possible, while still covering all costs. Any money raised above covering costs is re-invested in Betty's upkeep and CSEG to pay for social events. To balance this, Betty normally charges a fixed overhead above what the store's price is, so prices change as stores raise their prices or have a sale.

To learn more about about Betty, go visit the grad lounge -- located in BBB 2817 on the second floor, just off the landing from the straight stairs -- or take a digital tour at [chezbetty.eecs.umich.edu](https://chezbetty.eecs.umich.edu).

*Note:* Chez Betty is not affiliated with CSEG.
